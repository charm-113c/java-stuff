I'm despairing over how stupid this code is. Of course, we could finish it, but as you can see,
we're playing all the wrong moves. 
Deep down, you know the best move is to remember the cards we've placed and place the ones we haven't.
It's more expensive space-wise, but really, it's a matter of bytes.
And yet you want both. Both space and time efficiency.
In truth, you have a mind that it all can be done with the strict minimum amount of space 
and in the least possible amount of time, at once. That is, a single data structure to remember the cards,
but also to check for presence.
So if that's what you want, then that's what you should search for. You are bending to the tools you've created,
you're allowing them to dictate your actions, to limitate you. It shouldn't be that way. You create the 
tools as you see fit, and they merely obey. So, think.
